Local Outlier Factor (LOF):\n","LOF values close to 1 indicate that the data point is similar in density to its neighbors.\n","LOF values significantly greater than 1 indicate that the data point is in a region of lower density compared to its neighbors, suggesting it may be an outlier.\n","The further the LOF value is from 1, the more anomalous the data point is considered.\n","\n","2. Sign of the LOF:\n","The negative sign in negative_outlier_factor_ simply denotes that it's the \"opposite\" LOF, meaning the reciprocal of the LOF values. This is done for mathematical convenience.\n","\n","3. Interpretation:\n","Higher negative values indicate higher outlier scores, suggesting stronger evidence of being an outlier.\n","Lower (less negative) values indicate data points that are less likely to be outliers.\n","\n","4. Thresholding:\n","You can set a threshold to identify outliers. Data points with negative_outlier_factor_ below a certain threshold may be considered outliers.\n","\n","5. Comparing Values:\n","You can compare the negative_outlier_factor_ values across different data points. Points with significantly lower values compared to others might be more likely to be outliers.\n","\n","6.
